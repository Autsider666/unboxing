                <p>Hello there and welcome to Unboxing! <br><br>It looks like you are new, so here are some tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Try training against an <span class="highlight">Infant</span> or two and gather some experience and loot chests.</li>
                    <li>- You can only store a limited amount of loot in your <span class="highlight">Hammerspace</span>.</li>
                    <li>- An item will be randomly picked from the crates that you gain after it's full.</li>
                    <li>- You can try out gear and stat point combinations all you want on your <span class="highlight">Prototype</span> until you use construct it.</li>
                    <li>- Your <span class="highlight">Active bot</span> has fixed stats and you'll lose the installed items when switching it out with something new (when not in combat)  .</li>
                    <li>
                        - you get stat points every time you level up to spend in <span class="highlight">your workshop</span> on your prototype. <br>
                        <br>
                        This is (roughly) what the stats do:
                        <ul class="sub-list">
                            <li>- <span class="highlight">Strength</span>: More damage.</li>
                            <li>- <span class="highlight">Dexterity</span>: More accuracy and dodge.</li>
                            <li>- <span class="highlight">Constitution</span>: More HP.</li>
                            <li>- <span class="highlight">Intelligence</span>: More experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Have fun! There's no "right" way to play, so play however you want. :)</li>
                </ul>
